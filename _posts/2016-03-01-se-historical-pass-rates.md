## Historical NCEES SE Exam Pass Rates
_Updated January 4, 2023_

The 16-hour format of the Structural Engineering exam was introduced in April 2011. Beginning in October of that year, I started recording the pass rates after each exam administration. The information provided here was obtained directly from NCEES unless otherwise noted. I've also developed a "Difficulty Rank" metric in an attempt to quantify how difficult each exam was relative to every other administration of the exam since 2011 (a rank of 1 = hardest exam since 2011 relative to every other exam listed in the table).

This table is updated twice a year in January and June.

If you have data you'd like to share with me so that I can include it here, please get in touch via email.
